//(4 points) Write a program that shows both ways of declaring a function.  Be sure to actually somehow use both functions that you write.


//longer function
var longer  = function(){

	console.log('This is the longer and more versitile declaration');

}

//shorter function
function shorter(){

	console.log('This is the shorter more convienient declaration');
}

//run both functions
longer();
shorter();
